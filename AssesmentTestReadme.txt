Good Afternoon, I hope you're doing well . This is a readme file to run tests . Following are the instructions:

- If you want to run all cases together, run TestRunner.js file (without changing cypress.config.js)
- run command npx cypress open or run in terminal

- If you want to run single feature file, uncomment // specPattern: "cypress/**/*.feature" and comment specPattern: "cypress/**/*.js"
- run command npx cypress open or run in terminal
